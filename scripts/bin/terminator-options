              Start with a fullscreen window

       -b, --borderless

              wishes of the child shell.

       --geometry=GEOMETRY
              Specifies the preferred size and position of Terminator's window; see X(7).

       -e, --command=COMMAND
              Runs  the specified command instead of your default shell or profile specified command. Note: if Termi‐
              nator is launched as x-terminal-emulator -e behaves like -x, and the longform  becomes  --execute2=COM‐
              MAND

              fied functions. If this is specified in addition to --debug-classes, only the intersection of  the  two
              lists will be displayed

       --new-tab
              If  this  is  specified  and Terminator is already running, DBus will be used to spawn a new tab in the
